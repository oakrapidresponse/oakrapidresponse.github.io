## Summary

There is strong neighborhood support prioritizing safety over vehicle throughput. Neighbors ranked “Feels Safe” as their number one priority, and ranked high-quality bike lanes as priority number 1 and transit lanes as priority number 2. There was no documented support for the status quo of four vehicle lanes.

The redundant vehicle travel lanes facilitate Grand being used for speeding. Traffic studies show 15-30% of drivers had other better highway on-ramp options but are diverting to Grand to use the extra lanes to speed in excess of 45 mph on a 25 mph street alongside a park.

Even with the extra traffic using Grand as a highway on-ramp, repurposing travel lanes is not expected to significantly impact vehicle travel times because both daily and peak vehicle volumes are low enough that two vehicle lanes with left turn lanes can handle that level of traffic without congestion.

With the upcoming paving plan for Grand, hundreds of neighbors and dozens of businesses recently [renewed their support](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/a-safer-better-grand-avenue-at-lake-merritt) for a safety first plan that prioritizes:

1. Lane reductions
2. Pedestrian safety features
3. Transit improvements
4. High-quality bicycle facilities

## Grand Avenue Mobility Plan

In 2019, Oakland convened multiple stakeholders to develop a plan for the Grand Avenue corridor. From the Grand Avenue Mobility Plan [website](https://www.oaklandca.gov/projects/grand-avenue-mobility-plan):

> [The Grand Avenue Mobility Plan](https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/GAMP-final-02-28-22.pdf) is a collaboration between OakDOT, AC Transit, community-based organizations, and Oaklanders along the corridor to conceptualize an implementable plan that will enhance transit service and improve traffic safety on this high injury corridor without impeding goods movement.

Lake Merritt is one the most popular areas of the city with the Adam's Point section of Grand being particularly popular for people walking especially from Downtown.

> The Adams Point area of the corridor generates the most pedestrian activity of any segment. Most of these trips start or end north of Lake Merritt or in Downtown. The destinations and higher residential density in this area create the largest pedestrian catchment area, pulling or sending pedestrians from East Lake and Fruitvale to West Oakland to the Oakland Hills to Jack London Square.

### Safety

Grand is on Oakland’s High Injury Network - the 6% of City streets that are responsible for 60% of reported collisions. 139 people were injured or killed in reported traffic collisions on Grand from 2011-2022. Grand Avenue has high rates of drivers hitting pedestrians and bicyclists compared to the city  average: 47% of collisions on Grand involved people walking or biking, compared to only 20% Citywide.

> Pedestrian-involved collisions account for about 17% of collisions along the corridor. Figure 18 identifies the Pedestrian Action, what the pedestrian’s action was during the collision. It is important to note that 68% of pedestrian collisions occurred in a marked crosswalk at an intersection, with another 5% occurring in a midblock crosswalk; in total almost three-quarters of pedestrian-involved collisions occur at a marked crosswalk. [...] Bicyclists-involved collisions account for about 21% of all collisions along the corridor.

### Transit

Grand is served by the local 12 bus with 20-30 minute frequencies and the transbay NL bus with 15-30 minute frequencies. From a 2019 transit study, there were 570 daily boardings and alightings per day on Grand in Adams Point, with many more passing through on their way to downtown or to SF. The 12 is the 13th most popular local bus with a total daily ridership of 2000 people, and the NL is the most popular transbay bus with a daily ridership of 1800 people.

> On average, there are 950 boardings and alightings per day. Two stops are served by both the 12 and NL; these are two stops with the highest ridership activity. Both of these stops are at Grand Avenue/Perkins Street. The eastbound stop has about 158 boardings and alightings daily and the westbound stop has about 150 daily boardings and alightings. [...] About 60% of these bus trips start or end in the Adams Point area and about one-quarter of them start or end in West Oakland.

![alt_text](/images/grand/03.png "Transit usage on Grand")

In 2019 the travel time of the 12 and the NL increased during peak commute hours on the Adams Point section by 2 minutes for the trip from Downtown to MacArthur taking 7 minutes in the evening and 5 minutes in the morning. The study did not go into the reasons for this increase which could be due to longer boarding time for more riders, wait time to re-enter travel lane from bus stop, waiting behind car congestion, etc.

> Slowdowns were most pronounced in the peak direction of the Downtown and Adams Point segments with average speeds decreasing 25% in the eastbound direction during the evening peak hours and 7% in the westbound direction during the morning peak hours when compared with the average travel speed during other periods

### Vehicles

According to the traffic study conducted in 2019, at peak times there was at worst a 25 second delay to vehicle traffic, all intersections had excess operating capacity to handle traffic volumes, and there were no queuing issues in Adam's Point section:

> Under optimal operating conditions, all studied intersections along the corridor have excess operating capacity as currently configured. Table 8 on pg. 64 shows the results of LOS Analysis. A vehicle queuing analysis was also conducted to measure how far cars back-up while waiting to move through an intersection. [...] All other queues have excess storage space except at the northbound and southbound _approaches at the Telegraph Avenue intersection.

![alt_text](/images/grand/05.png "Vehicle delays on Grand")

According to this study about 13% of traffic on Grand is using it as an indirect on-ramp to 580 instead of using a closer highway entrance, with 20% of traffic passing by earlier on-ramps on Grand and 67% of those continuing to the MacArthur on-ramp:

> I-580 is a common destination for many vehicles that travel along the Grand Avenue Corridor, **including those exiting the Bay Bridge**. In some cases, vehicles are using the corridor as a cut-through street to avoid highway congestion. On-ramps are accessible via MacArthur Boulevard, Harrison Street, and via I-980 from Brush Street or Northgate Avenue. [...] Vehicles accessing I-580 accounted for about 20% of eastbound traffic through the Telegraph Avenue intersection. Of these vehicles, 67% of them continue to the MacArthur Boulevard on-ramp and 17% enter via Harrison Street.

### Community

As a part of this study the city gathered feedback from residents who overwhelmingly supported designs that focused on walking and biking, and identified fast aggressive highway traffic, large and wide intersections, and limited bicycle and pedestrian facilities as their primary issues to fix

> Over 1,400 people submitted survey responses and over 500 people provided comments on the interactive webmap. [...] Many cited pedestrian infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, traffic calming, and greening/ landscaping as priorities for the corridor.

![alt_text](/images/grand/06.png "Survey Results")

The city presented 4 options to gather priorities from residents and received overwhelming support for the options with one travel lane each direction and high-quality bike and pedestrian safety infrastructure with a close second of bus-only lanes. There was very little support for the status quo of two vehicle travel lanes each direction.

> The virtual open house drew another 440 participants. Participants ranked “Feels Safe” as the most important corridor goal. Virtual open house participants, regardless of neighborhood, expressed the most favorable responses to the Bicycle/Micromobility Focus (77%) and Activated Median (72%) options.

### Vision

The resulting recommendation of this study was to implement a plan for Grand that focuses on safety by repurposing vehicle travel lanes to reduce traffic speeds and crosswalk compliance and use the space for high-quality bicycle facilities, pedestrian safety features, and dedicated transit lanes. The main impediment to this plan is that it requires $118M in funding. On the bright side, there are opportunities to implement some of this vision incrementally via repaving projects.

> Planning-level cost estimates to implement the Grand Ave Mobility Plan are $118M. The OakDOT two-year Capital Improvement Program budget is about $175M, the bulk of which is spent on repaving Oakland’s streets. As a result, implementation of the Grand Avenue Mobility Plan will likely come in stages and with funding support from federal, state and regional grants. Upcoming repaving projects on West Grand Avenue and Grand Avenue provide opportunities to begin to realize the goals of the Grand Avenue Mobility Plan.

## OakDOT Paving Project

The [Grand Avenue Complete Streets Paving Project](https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Grand-Online-Presentation_update-w-concept-031022.pdf) segment between Broadway and Elwood is part of an upcoming paving project. In 2022 a 15% stage of design was shared with the community. This level of design shows how the main elements of the right-of-way can be arranged, and what lane reductions, signal changes, islands and bulbouts, etc. might be included. This gives all stakeholders a chance to see what is proposed, and in conjunction with the Mobility Plan study, why changes are proposed.

### 15% Design

The Grand Avenue Redesign 15% plan ([design drawings](https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Grand-Ave-15-Design-DRAFT_100622_web.pdf)) proposed a reduction from 4 travel lanes to 3 with two lanes eastbound and one lane westbound. The design did not include a standard 4 to 2 lane reduction probably because the 2019 traffic study showed a higher level of commute usage eastbound in the evenings.

In addition to calming traffic the lane reduction made space for pedestrian bulb-outs, center refuge islands, crossing signals, shortened crossing distances and bus boarding islands. The bus boarding islands increase rider comfort and safety, and improve bus travel times by decreasing time waiting at the bus stop to re-enter travel lane.

The separated two-way cycle track currently along the west side of the lake was to be extended onto Grand, along the lake-side of the street to Bellevue, then following Bellevue past Fairyland and the botanical garden, emerging back to Grand, and continuing to El Embarcadero to Lakeshore. In addition, a protected bike lane was proposed for the west-bound side of Grand with a one-way protected bike lane on the eastbound side where the two-way cycletrack is absent.

Here is a sample road segment from this design (mottled brown = raised concrete elements):

### 35% Design

The recently-released [35% Concept Plan](https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Grand-Ave-35.pdf) version reverses several of the 15% safety features by retaining the status quo of two vehicle travel lanes in each direction with center turn lanes, and expands parking to remove the cycle track.

This change means a road design where vehicles would be able maintain speeds of over 45 mph in direct conflict with pedestrian safety. Faster-moving vehicles are more deadly in collisions, drivers have less time to react, and often when one driver slows for someone to cross, another might change lanes to continue driving, without a clear sightline to the crossing pedestrian, setting up a high-risk situation. The median refuge islands (raised concrete islands between eastern and western directions) allowing people to cross the street in two stages, remain in only two crosswalks out of 22 marked crosswalks.

The high-quality cycle-track was replaced with a barely functional 4.5 ft one-way protected bike lane on each side that includes the gutter pan, storm drains, vehicle loading zone, and other obstacles. NACTO guidelines for a protected bikeway is a minimum of 5 ft and recommends 6 ft for low usage bikeways and 7ft for high usage to allow for passing.

## Proposal

### Lane Reduction

First and foremost, the Adam’s Point segment of Grand needs only one vehicle travel lane in each direction, and we urge that this be the basis for the rest of the plan. Multi-lane surface streets are inherently dangerous, and traffic volumes do not warrant them.

### Pedestrian Safety

Second, Oaklanders need protection when crossing the street, and this means shorter crossing distances, concrete islands in the median, and signal timings that allow our most vulnerable users time enough to cross while they have the light. As people walking become more comfortable, more people are drawn to walk, and the area thrives.

### Transit Improvements

Third, improvements as called out in the AC Transit Grand Ave. Rapid Corridors Project plan should be implemented. These include the adjustment and lengthening of bus stops, signal changes, and bus boarding islands that provide safe comfortable bus stops with in-lane boarding so that buses do not need to re-merge with traffic.

### Bike lanes

Fourth, the two-way cycle track around the lake should be reinstated along with a full-width continuous protected bike lane on both sides of the street. This is a key amenity for bike commuters, families with children, and people coming to enjoy the lake and area businesses.
