The last few years of traffic violence have made the reality of our crisis all but undeniable. What can our city do to react to these tragedies in a meaningful way? Below are our 8 top actions we ugre leadership in the Oakland Mayor's Office, the Department of Transportation and at AC Transit to act on, immediately:

1. Remove the extreme visibility danger on all multi-lane stroads by converting them to streets with a single car lane per direction

2. Daylight all intersections and install bollards or flex-posts to create pedestrian bulb-outs and prevent cars from taking turns at high speeds

3. Allow for emergency flex-post and k-rail installations for quick-builds until resources are organized to prioritize long-term permanent safety changes

4. Install wheel-stops to create temporary protected intersections until permanent safety upgrades can occur

5. Remove parking where door-zone conflicts with the bicycle lane

6. Establish a default design width of 10' car lanes, 11' bus lanes

7. Place physical barriers between all bus-only lanes and car lanes, to prevent the bus-lane from use as a speedway

8. Prioritize safety and equity over throughput by rescinding "traffic study" protocol prior to implementing traffic calming or lane re-allocation
