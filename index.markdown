# Projects

TVRR is actively fighting to address severe deficiencies in roadway design through vigils (as highlighted in this [newspiece](https://oaklandside.org/2022/10/20/traffic-violence-rapid-response-team-oakland/)) as well as policy changes in the way Oakland approaches roadway design and priortization of traffic modes. A few key projects are listed below.

### International Blvd. pedestrian safety

<a name="international_project"></a>

The International BRT lanes are unsafe and, frankly, incomplete in their current form. Our latest [report, published in June 2023](/international), analyzed over 7 million vehicle traces along the International AC Transit TEMPO BRT corridor to identify the road reconfiguration's impact on general traffic speeds.

[![international](/images/international_01.png)](/international){: width="100%" }
{: style="text-align: center"}

A prior analysis, [published here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQJ2af5Ym0v-JGOWs1KSdW7F-xLnvl8haxBuNI41vKPMUZHOycIin63Yyd2p-uXxFv0gZVZzsFOHWfz/pub), catalogued the most dangerous patterns of driving and identified focus areas for intervention.


As of December 2022, Oakland has [allocated funds](https://twitter.com/RapidRevolt/status/1602398196218462208) to rapidly deploy pedestrian safety interventions along Oakland's deadliest road.

### Oakland Fire Code minimum street widths

Oakland city council is currently reviewing the 2022 California Fire Code, and has a chance to change the fire code to make Oakland safer for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. Read our [policy brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vv4fSy-y_nsI3zeRdalISv9lCO-zr5RffmaY9WEn1qI/), as well as [this Oaklandside article](https://oaklandside.org/2022/12/07/street-safety-advocates-want-narrower-roads-the-fire-department-is-opposed/), for more details.

### OakDOT funding FY23-25

TVRR calls upon the Mayor and Council to invest in true public safety from traffic violence by redirecting $20 million in funds from the Oakland Police Department to the Department of Transportation needed for critical street safety infrastructure.
