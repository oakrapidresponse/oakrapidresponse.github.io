Today, the streets of Oakland allow vehicle traffic to dominate our public space, enabling dangerous driving. Traffic Violence Rapid Response (TVRR) are working to change this.

> By calling attention to the terrible consequences of traffic violence while advocating for specific street improvements, TVRR contributes to a _safer, more vibrant, and more joyous Oakland_.

Weâ€™ve already made an impact. Neighbors from across Oakland and beyond have contributed their time, effort, and love to actions we help organize.

# Fatalities

Oakland's streets are in crisis. Virtually every major road in Oakland is buckling under the weight of numerous, and rapidly increasing, severe injuries and fatalities. Explore the map below to see the sheer scale of the crisis or follow along below as TVRR seeks to catalogue every new tragedy as well as hold vigils to ensure that all get the respect and solemn aknowledgement they deserve.

# Projects

TVRR is actively fighting to address severe deficiencies in roadway design through vigils (as highlighted in this [newspiece](https://oaklandside.org/2022/10/20/traffic-violence-rapid-response-team-oakland/)) as well as policy changes in the way Oakland approaches roadway design and priortization of traffic modes. A few key projects are listed below.

### OakDOT funding FY23-25

TVRR calls upon the Mayor and Council to invest in true public safety from traffic violence by redirecting $20 million in funds from the Oakland Police Department to the Department of Transportation needed for critical street safety infrastructure.

### International Blvd. pedestrian safety

<a name="international_project"></a>

The International BRT lanes are unsafe and, frankly, incomplete in their current form. This project, [published here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQJ2af5Ym0v-JGOWs1KSdW7F-xLnvl8haxBuNI41vKPMUZHOycIin63Yyd2p-uXxFv0gZVZzsFOHWfz/pub), catalogued the most dangerous patterns of driving and identify focus areas for intervention.

As of December 2022, Oakland has [allocated funds](https://twitter.com/RapidRevolt/status/1602398196218462208) to rapidly deploy pedestrian safety interventions along Oakland's deadliest road.

### Oakland Fire Code minimum street widths

Oakland city council is currently reviewing the 2022 California Fire Code, and has a chance to change the fire code to make Oakland safer for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. Read our [policy brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vv4fSy-y_nsI3zeRdalISv9lCO-zr5RffmaY9WEn1qI/), as well as [this Oaklandside article](https://oaklandside.org/2022/12/07/street-safety-advocates-want-narrower-roads-the-fire-department-is-opposed/), for more details.
